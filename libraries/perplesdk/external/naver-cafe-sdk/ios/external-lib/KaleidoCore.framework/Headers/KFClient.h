/**
 * A KFClient attaches multiple KFData s, and is responsible for storing them in local repository and synchronizes with the Kaleido Server.
 *
 * KFClient enables various datatypes of KFData to be created and attached.
 * If a Kaleido client locally creates KFData , you can use that datatype as if you use datatypes in C++ such as std::map and std::list.
 * A locally created KFData needs to be authorized by the Kaleido Cloud, and KFClient requests to the Kaleido Cloud to authorize it.
 * After authorizing datatypes, other Kaleido Clients can attach them.
 * KFClient can be obtained by KFClientManager with a client key which is locally unique.
 * KFClient can be in either state : connected or disconnected.
 * KFClient is responsible for connecting to the Kaleido Cloud, and exchanges operations.
 * KFClients are also responsible for storing the KFDatas in local storage.
 * KFClient stores the attachted(or created) KFDatas so that they are used when the client gets restarted.
 * When KFClient is connected, you can designate how to synchronize with Kaleido Cloud by AutoSync and WebSocketPushService.
 * If a client is disconnected, it cannot exchange operations with Kaleido Cloud.
